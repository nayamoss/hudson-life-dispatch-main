## Important Notes

**About the Data:**
- This research is based on publicly available information from late 2024 and December 2025
- All shops listed are independent (no chains)
- All have 4+ star ratings on Google
- Some smaller towns have fewer than 5 qualifying indie shops

2. **Add specific details** - You may want to add:
   - Exact addresses with zip codes
   - Phone numbers
   - Website URLs
   - Specific current Google ratings (X.X stars)
   - Price range ($, $$, $$$)
3. **Get photos** - Search each shop on Google Maps for images
4. **Customize** - Add your own intro/outro paragraphs
5. **Verify** - Check Google Maps to confirm they're still open
