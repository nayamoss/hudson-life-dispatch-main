- **Best case**: 13 cents per signup

## 📊 SUCCESS METRICS

### Week 1 Goals:
- **Cost per click**: $0.50-1.50 (anything under $2 is okay)
- **Landing page conversion**: 30-50% (clicks → signups)
- **Cost per subscriber**: $1-2 (optimize to $0.30-0.50)
- **Total spend**: $70-140 ($10-20/day)
- **New subscribers**: 70-140

### If Numbers Are Bad:

**High cost per click (>$2)**:
- Targeting too narrow
- Creative not compelling
- Expand audience

**Low conversion rate (<20%)**:
- Landing page problem (not ad problem)
- Fix landing page first
- Make CTA clearer

**Cost per subscriber >$2**:
- Keep testing
- Try different ad copy
- Try different images
- Adjust targeting

---

## 🔄 PHASE 3: OPTIMIZE (Weeks 2-4)

### Test These Variables (One at a Time):

**Week 2: Test Images**
- Ad 1: Beautiful Westchester photo
- Ad 2: Newsletter screenshot
- Ad 3: Simple graphic
- Keep same text

**Week 3: Test Copy**
- Ad 1: Benefit-focused ("Never miss...")
- Ad 2: Social proof ("Join 1,000...")
- Ad 3: Specific ("30+ events...")
- Keep same image

**Week 4: Test Targeting**
- Ad Set 1: Westchester only
- Ad Set 2: + NYC weekenders
- Ad Set 3: Narrow interests (foodies, arts lovers)
- Keep same creative

### Optimization Tips:

1. **Turn off bad ads fast** (if not working after $20 spent)
2. **Scale what works** (increase budget on winning ads)
3. **Test one thing at a time** (or you won't know what worked)
4. **Give ads 2-3 days** to optimize before judging

---

## 🎯 ADVANCED TARGETING (After Initial Success)

### Lookalike Audiences (After 100-200 Subs):
1. Create "Custom Audience" from your email list
2. Create "Lookalike Audience" (1%-3%)
3. Target people similar to your subscribers
4. Usually converts better than cold audience

### Retargeting (After 1,000 Page Views):
1. Create audience: "Visited landing page, didn't subscribe"
2. Show them different ad
3. Cheaper conversions (they already showed interest)

### Interest Stacking:
Narrow targeting by combining interests:
- People interested in "Local news" AND "Food and dining"
- People interested in "Arts" AND "Live in Westchester"

---

## 🚨 COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### 1. Targeting Too Narrow
❌ **Don't**: Target only "People interested in newsletters"  
✅ **Do**: Start broad (Westchester + basic interests)

### 2. Testing Too Many Things
❌ **Don't**: Change image, copy, and targeting at once  
✅ **Do**: Test one variable at a time

### 3. Giving Up Too Fast
❌ **Don't**: Turn off ads after $50 if not perfect  
✅ **Do**: Give it $200-300 to learn what works

### 4. No Budget
❌ **Don't**: Try $5/day (Meta won't optimize)  
✅ **Do**: Minimum $10/day, ideally $15-20/day

### 5. Bad Landing Page
❌ **Don't**: Run ads to a bad landing page  
✅ **Do**: Test landing page organically first

### 6. No Tracking
❌ **Don't**: Run ads without pixel/tracking  
✅ **Do**: Install pixel, track conversions, optimize

---

## 📈 SCALE STRATEGY

### Once You're Getting $0.50/Sub or Better:

**Week 5-8**: Increase budget 20% per week
- Week 5: $100/week → 200 subs
- Week 6: $120/week → 240 subs
- Week 7: $140/week → 280 subs
- Week 8: $160/week → 320 subs

**Week 9-12**: Maintain or increase
- Keep going until you hit 1,000 (or pause if needed)

### Warning Signs to Slow Down:
- Cost per sub increases >$1
- Landing page conversion drops
- Ad fatigue (people see same ad too many times)

**If this happens**: Pause, create new creatives, resume
