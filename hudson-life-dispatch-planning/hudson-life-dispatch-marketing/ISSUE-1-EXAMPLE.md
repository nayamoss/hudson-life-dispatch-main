**Subject Line**: "Jan 2-5"

Hey,

Happy New Year. I'm writing this from a coffee shop in Tarrytown on a Tuesday morning, watching people walk by with that post-holiday "what now?" look.

I get it. The holidays are over, the kids are back in school, and you're thinking "what the hell do I do this weekend?"

That's why I started this.

Every Thursday morning, I'm going to send you this email. Not a ton of fluff. Just the actual things happening in our towns this weekend that are worth your time. Events I'd actually go to. Places I'd actually take my family.

No algorithms. No endless scrolling. Just me, doing the work for you.

This weekend, there's a lot happening. I counted 32 events worth going to. Here's what caught my eye:

## 🎭 This Weekend

### Friday, Jan 3

**Live Jazz at The Turning Point** (Piermont, 8pm)
If you've never been, go. It's dark, it's intimate, and the music is always good. $15 cover. Bring cash.

**First Friday Art Walk** (Peekskill, 6-9pm)
Walk around, see some art, maybe buy something. Free. The galleries are all within walking distance, which is the whole point.

**Trivia Night at The Goose** (Tarrytown, 7pm)
I've been going to this for 2 years. The questions are hard. The beer is cold. We never win.

### Saturday, Jan 4

**Winter Farmers Market** (Ossining, 9am-1pm)
Yes, in winter. Root vegetables, bread, cheese. The good stuff. Bring a tote bag.

**Vintage Film Screening: Casablanca** (Tarrytown Music Hall, 7pm)
On the big screen. The way it's supposed to be seen. $12.

**Open Mic Night** (Yonkers, 8pm)
Hit or miss, but that's the fun of it. Free.

### Sunday, Jan 5

**Yoga in the Park** (Rockwood Hall, 10am)
Dress warm. It's free but they ask for donations.

**Family Brunch at The Hudson Room** (Ossining, 10am-2pm)
Their pancakes are ridiculous. I'm not being paid to say this. Just go.

## 📖 This Week's Spotlight: Maria's Bakery in Dobbs Ferry

You know that bakery on Main Street that you've driven past 100 times but never stopped at?

Go there.

Maria opened it 3 months ago. She's originally from Sicily. She makes everything herself. The cannoli are stupid good.

I stopped in last Tuesday. She was behind the counter, covered in flour, laughing with a customer about her oven breaking down the day before. She had to bake everything at 4am when it finally got fixed.

That's the thing about small businesses in our towns - they're barely holding on, but they're the reason our towns feel like *something* instead of just another strip of chain stores.

Maria's open Tue-Sun, 7am-3pm. Cash only. The sfogliatelle is my recommendation if you've never had it before.

## 🍺 Chugability Report: Sleepy Hollow Brewing

Tried their winter IPA last weekend. 7.2% ABV, which is sneaky.

**Chugability:** 6/10. It's good, but pace yourself. Two of these and you're done.

**Vibe:** Cozy, brick walls, good for groups. Gets loud on weekends.

**Would I go back?** Yeah. The bartender was cool and they had a food truck outside.

## 🐶 Adopt a Pup: Meet Benny

Benny is a 4-year-old beagle mix at the Ossining shelter. He's chill, good with kids, terrible on a leash (working on it).

If you've been thinking about getting a dog, go meet him. Seriously. Don't wait.

**Hudson Valley Humane Society** - Open 7 days a week.

That's it. 32 events, one bakery recommendation, one dog who needs a home.

See you next Thursday.

[Your Name]

P.S. - Forward this to a friend who always asks "what should we do this weekend?" They'll thank you.
