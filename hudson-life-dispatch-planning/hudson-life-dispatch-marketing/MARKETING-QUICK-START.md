- Add Instagram Reels (weekly "this weekend" videos)
- Partner with 10 total venues

---

### If You Have 50-99 Subscribers:

**You're on track, but need optimization.**

**Adjust**:
- Test different Facebook post formats
- Try posting at different times (morning vs evening)
- Interview 10 subscribers: "What would make this better?"
- Add referral incentive: "Forward to a friend"

**Give it 30 more days**, aim for 200 subscribers by Day 60.

---

### If You Have <50 Subscribers:

**Something's not working. Investigate:**

Questions to ask:
1. Is the newsletter content good? (are people opening it?)
2. Are Facebook posts being seen? (check group rules, post timing)
3. Is the value proposition clear? (do people understand what they get?)
4. Are you targeting the right audience? (maybe different towns?)

**Options**:
- Pivot messaging
- Try different distribution channels (Instagram first?)
- Narrow geography (just Ossining to start?)
- Talk to 5 people who didn't subscribe: "Why not?"

---

3. ❌ **Giving up after Week 1**
   - ✅ Do: 30 days minimum before evaluating

4. ❌ **Not responding to comments**
   - ✅ Do: Reply to every single comment within 2 hours

6. ❌ **Not asking for feedback**
   - ✅ Do: Add "Reply with feedback!" to every newsletter

---

## 💡 QUICK WINS

**If you're stuck**, try these:
1. **Post in largest Facebook group first** (more eyes = more signups)
2. **DM 5 active group members**: "Hey, I made this newsletter, would you check it out?"
3. **Offer venue partners free featured placement** (make it irresistible)
4. **Add to email signature**: "PS: Check out my Westchester events newsletter: [link]"
5. **Post in NextDoor** (very local, very engaged)
