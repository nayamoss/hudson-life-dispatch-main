## 🤔 KEY QUESTIONS ANSWERED

### "Which model should I follow?"

**Start with Catskill Crew model**:
- Weekly (Tuesday) - sustainable
- Long-form (14-16 min) - proven
- Multiple revenue (ads + premium + shop) - diversified
- Strong brand ("Join the Society") - memorable

### "Can I really make $200K/year?"

**Yes, here's the math**:
- 10,000 subscribers × $11/year ads = $110K
- 500 premium members × $11/month = $66K
- Shop: $24K/year
- **Total**: $200K/year

Naptown Scoop does $200K with 23K subs. Catskill Crew does more with 40K.

### "How long will this take?"

**Realistic timeline**:
- Month 3: First revenue ($1-2K/month)
- Month 6: Sustainable ($4-5K/month)
- Month 12: Full-time income ($17-20K/month)
- Year 2-3: Catskill Crew level (if you scale)

### "What if I can't commit full-time?"

**Weekly newsletter = 4-5 hours/week**:
- 2 hours: Content research/curation
- 2 hours: Writing newsletter
- 1 hour: Community management/replies

**Plus initial setup** (one-time):
- Landing page: 4-6 hours
- First 3 newsletters: 12-15 hours
- Meta ads setup: 2-3 hours

**Start part-time, scale to full-time** when revenue supports it.

### "What if Westchester is too small?"

**Westchester is perfect**:
- 1M residents
- + 8M NYC weekenders (30-60 min away)
- Total addressable: 9M people
- Catskill Crew: 40K subs from smaller region
- **You can easily get 10-40K subscribers**
