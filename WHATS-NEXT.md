**Date**: December 28, 2025  
**Based on**: The 4 Models (Catskill Crew, Winnipeg Digest, Naptown Scoop, Salina311)

---

## 🎯 MAKE THESE DECISIONS FIRST

### Decision 1: Name
**Options**:
- ☐ "The Weekend Society" (new brand, like Catskill Crew's "Join the Crew")

**Recommendation**: "The Weekend Society" - strongest brand

---

### Decision 2: Frequency
**Options**:
- ☐ Weekly (Tuesday) - Catskill Crew model, easier to sustain
- ☐ 3x/week (Mon/Wed/Fri) - Winnipeg Digest model, more engagement
- ☐ Daily (M-F) - Naptown Scoop model, requires team

**Recommendation**: Start weekly (Tuesday), scale to 3x later if automated

---

### Decision 3: Platform
**Options**:
- ☐ Beehiiv (proven by 3 of the 4 models)
- ☐ Substack (alternative)
- ☐ Custom (like you have now)

**Recommendation**: Beehiiv (proven, easier to monetize)
