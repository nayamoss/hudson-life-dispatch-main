## Next Steps

### 1. Database Import
Import all CSV files into your Laravel/Filament admin:
```bash
# Command to import resources (if you have an import command)
php artisan resources:import storage/app/yonkers_resources.csv
php artisan resources:import storage/app/tarrytown_resources.csv
php artisan resources:import storage/app/dobbsferry_resources.csv
php artisan resources:import storage/app/sleepyhollow_resources.csv
php artisan resources:import storage/app/ossining_resources.csv
php artisan resources:import storage/app/peekskill_resources.csv
php artisan resources:import storage/app/croton_resources.csv
php artisan resources:import storage/app/irvington_resources.csv
php artisan resources:import storage/app/westchester_regional_resources.csv
```

### 2. Scraper Configuration
Set up scrapers for each source type:

**High Priority (Daily Scraping):**
- Official government calendars
- Major venue calendars (Tarrytown Music Hall, Paramount HV)
- Calendar aggregators (Burbio, OssiningEvents, Visit Sleepy Hollow)
- ArtsWestchester Events
- Social media accounts for major venues

**Medium Priority (Weekly Scraping):**
- Library event calendars
- Restaurant/bar Facebook pages
- Historic site calendars
- Arts organization websites
- Running and hiking club calendars

**Low Priority (Monthly/Seasonal Scraping):**
- Historical society calendars
- Seasonal events (farmers markets in season only)
- Annual festivals (check 1-2 months before event)

### 3. Scraper Development Strategy

**Phase 1: HTML Scrapers**
- Start with official government calendars (standardized formats)
- Library calendars (many use LibCal)
- ArtsWestchester and other arts organization calendars

**Phase 2: Social Media**
- Facebook Events API integration
- Instagram hashtag and location monitoring
- Meetup API integration

**Phase 3: Specialized Scrapers**
- Historic Hudson Valley (covers multiple sites)
- Jazz Forum Arts (covers 5 concert locations)
- RiverArts (multi-venue event)

### 4. Data Quality
- Set up duplicate detection (same event on multiple sources)
- Verify date/time parsing accuracy
- Confirm location mapping to correct towns
- Image scraping for event photos

### 5. Testing Priorities
Test scrapers in this order:
1. ArtsWestchester Events Calendar (comprehensive, well-structured)
2. Visit Westchester NY Events (tourism-focused)
3. Tarrytown Music Hall (major venue, ticketed events)
4. Yonkers Public Library (high-volume programming)
5. Burbio aggregators (pre-aggregated community calendars)

### 6. Editorial Workflow
- Review scraped events for accuracy
- Add editorial descriptions where needed
- Categorize events (music, art, family, outdoor, etc.)
- Tag with appropriate towns
- Set featured events for newsletter

## Source Reliability Ratings

### Tier 1 (Highest Reliability - Official Sources)

### Event Data Schema
Ensure scrapers extract:

- Cost (free, ticketed, suggested donation)
- Registration/ticket URL
